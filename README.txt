BLACKJACK
by Diane Yang

There are many variations of Blackjack, so here are a few notes about this implementation:

- This game uses 2 decks shuffled together.
- The table is limited to 10 people because in real life, the dealer only has a certain number of cards and can therefore only support a game with a certain maximum number of people.
- The dealer stands on a soft 17. That is, aces always have value 11 for the dealer.
- Players can bet any integer amount of money between 1 and their total cash. They are not allowed to be in the red. So, they cannot double down or split if they cannot afford it, and they're out of the game if they go bankrupt.
- If a player ties with a dealer, he/she neither loses nor wins money.
- Players can only split 2 cards if they have the same type. i.e. they cannot split a K and a 10 even though both of their values are 10.
